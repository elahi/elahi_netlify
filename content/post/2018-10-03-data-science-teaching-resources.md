In my new role as lecturer at Hopkins Marine Station, I am in the process of brainstorming my upcoming courses. One of these is 'Environmental Data Science', and as I was writing out the course schedule, I began to appreciate the dilemma of fitting in the appropriate mix of modern data carpentry skills with more traditional statistics requirements within the constraints of a 10 week schedule. One could make the case that these should be two separate courses, but that's another issue. After sketching out a variety of syllabi on my own (with help from a variety of texts; some syllabi from colleagues and the web) - I thought I would reach out to the many open science experts on the twitterverse - and the response was quick, generous, and super helpful - see [here](https://twitter.com/elahi_r/status/1046800931063361536). 

In fact, there was so much great material it begged for a bit more organization than a twitter feed. So, here is a quick and dirty list of useful resources. Many thanks to all that responded, and a huge thanks to the instructors who have made their course materials freely available - what an excellent example you have set for the rest of us.
