## Robin Elahi, PhD

<img src="/./about_files/Robin.jpg" alt="headshot" width="200px"/>   

I am a lecturer at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station, where I teach courses in kelp forest ecology, statistics, and scientific computing.  

In general, I study drivers of spatial and temporal change in marine ecosystems. Ongoing and recent projects include:

  - examining the consequences of fisheries closures on fisher behavior 
  
  - understanding why some coral reefs fare better than their neighbors 
  
  - biodiversity and body size change, particularly in the context of recent human impacts
