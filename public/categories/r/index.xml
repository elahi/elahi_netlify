      <description>In my new role as lecturer at Hopkins Marine Station, I am in the process of brainstorming my upcoming courses. One of these is &amp;lsquo;Environmental Data Science&amp;rsquo;, and as I was writing out the course schedule, I began to appreciate the dilemma of fitting in the appropriate mix of modern data carpentry skills with more traditional statistics requirements within the constraints of a 10 week schedule. One could make the case that these should be two separate courses, but that&amp;rsquo;s another issue.</description>

      <description>Introduction I am working on a project that is trying to understand why some coral reefs are faring better than others. Towards this end, I am collating a number of predictors hypothesized to influence the condition of coral reefs. In this post, I am going to demonstrate the steps necessary to take advantage of the awesome MSEC (marine socio-environmental covariates) dataset by Yeager et al. 2017.
There are two ways to go about extracting the geospatial data:</description>
