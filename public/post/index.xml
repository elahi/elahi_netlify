      <description>Introduction I am working on a project that is trying to understand why some coral reefs are faring better than others. Towards this end, I am collating a number of predictors hypothesized to influence the condition of coral reefs. In this post, I am going to demonstrate the steps necessary to take advantage of the awesome MSEC (marine socio-environmental covariates) dataset by Yeager et al. 2017.
There are two ways to go about extracting the geospatial data:</description>

In fact, the burden is so great that a new profession - medical scribe - has emerged. Medical scribes accompany physicians and manually transcribe their conversations and enter annotated notes into the electronic medical record. Bank and Gage (2015) demonstrated that cardiovascular physicians with scribes:</description>
