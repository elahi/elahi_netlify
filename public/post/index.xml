Towards this end, I am collating a number of predictors hypothesized to influence the condition of coral reefs. In this post, I am going to demonstrate the steps necessary to take advantage of this awesome dataset by Yeager et al. 2017.
There are two ways to go about extracting the geospatial data:</description>
